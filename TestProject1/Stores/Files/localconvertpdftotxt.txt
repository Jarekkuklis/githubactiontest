Could you pay less?
Your estimated annual cost is £0.00
*Based on current prices and including some discounts and added
charges, like VAT at 5%. This may be different to the way such charges
display on a bill or statement of account. Warm Home Discount is not
included. This is our estimate of your next 12 months energy charges.
You can use this to compare your current tariff with others available. It is
based on information we hold about you and reasonable assumptions
where we don't have actual data including your usage from the previous
year and your tariff remaining the same. If your tariff prices, tariff or
usage change, your spend will also change. Savings are calculated by
comparing the Estimated Annual Cost above, to 12 months on our
cheapest tariff for you. Includes VAT at 5%.
More information about your tariff can be found on the next page.
What is the Energy Bills Support Scheme (EBSS)?
The Energy Bills Support Scheme (EBSS) is a discount funded
by HM Government, totalling £400 which is being paid to
households over winter 2022/23 to assist with energy bills.
You do not need to apply for this discount, and you will not
need to repay it. This is one element of the government's
wider support to help with the cost of living. The scheme will
help around 29 million households across Great Britain and
forms part of the £37bn cost of living assistance package for
consumers over winter 2022/23.
